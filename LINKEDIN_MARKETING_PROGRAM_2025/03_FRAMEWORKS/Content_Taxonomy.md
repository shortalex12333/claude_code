4. **Include a conversation starter** (CTA that invites engagement)
5. **Be optimized for algorithm** (formatting, hooks, timing)

### ❌ Never:
1. Create pillar-less content (everything must have strategic purpose)
2. Over-index on one pillar (>40% of content from single pillar)
3. Ignore audience feedback (adjust pillars based on performance)
4. Sacrifice authenticity for virality
5. Post content that violates guardrails (no engagement bait, external links, etc.)
