## TROUBLESHOOTING FAQ

### Q: "I don't have time to write 5-8 posts/week"
**A:** You shouldn't be writing from scratch.
- Use Hook Library templates (fill-in-the-blanks)
- Use Post Structure templates (copy structure)
- Total time: 10-15 min per post
- If still too much: Reduce to 3 posts/week minimum

### Q: "I don't know what to write about a topic"
**A:** The calendar gives you the topic. If you're stuck:
1. Google the topic + your industry
2. Think of recent customer conversation about it
3. Check competitor posts on similar topic
4. Use hook library - pick any hook, fill in blanks

### Q: "My posts aren't getting engagement"
**A:** First 4 weeks are baseline. Don't panic. But check:
1. Posting at optimal time? (Tue/Wed 8-10am)
2. Replying to comments in first hour?
3. Engaging with others' content? (30 min/day)
4. Using specific CTAs? (not "thoughts?")

If yes to all and still low: Open Optimization_Playbook.md

### Q: "I'm getting engagement but no leads"
**A:** Two possibilities:
1. **Too early:** Leads take 4-8 weeks to materialize
2. **Wrong audience:** Review content - are you talking to your ICP?

Solution: Add more Pillar 5 (Customer Success) content with clear CTAs

### Q: "I missed a week of posting"
**A:** Don't panic. Resume immediately.
- Don't try to "catch up" with multiple posts in one day
- Just resume normal schedule
- Consistency > perfection

### Q: "The calendar topic doesn't fit my business"
**A:** Calendar is template. You should customize:
1. Keep the pillar distribution (%)
2. Keep the posting schedule (days/times)
3. Change specific topics to fit your business
4. Update calendar with your topics

### Q: "Can I change the strategy?"
**A:** Not in first 90 days.
- Execute framework as designed
- Track data religiously
- After 90 days: Review results together
- Then we can pivot based on data

Exception: If metrics are "Red Zone" (see Optimization_Playbook), make fixes immediately.
