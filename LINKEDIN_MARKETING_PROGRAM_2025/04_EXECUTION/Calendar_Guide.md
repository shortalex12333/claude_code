## EMERGENCY CONTENT PROTOCOL

If scheduled content becomes irrelevant (news event, crisis, opportunity):

### Decision Tree:
1. **Is scheduled content time-sensitive?**
   - NO → Swap with timely content
   - YES → Post both if valuable

2. **Does new topic fit a pillar?**
   - YES → Use existing structure
   - NO → Make it fit P2 (Industry Insights) or P3 (Thought Leadership)

3. **Can it be created in <2 hours?**
   - YES → Proceed
   - NO → Use backup content from library

### Backup Content Library:
Keep 5-10 "evergreen" posts pre-written for emergencies:
- Tactical guides (P1)
- Personal stories (P4)
- Resource lists (P6)
