**You own:** Personal page content
**Process:** Use quality checklist, self-approve
**Risk:** Low (personal brand, can iterate)

### Small Team (Peer Review)
**You own:** Personal + company page
**Process:**
1. Creator drafts post
2. Peer reviews against checklist
3. Creator implements feedback
4. Both sign off
**Timeline:** 24-hour turnaround

### Larger Org (Formal Approval)
**You own:** Company page + exec personal pages
**Process:**
1. Creator drafts post using templates
2. Manager reviews against checklist (24 hours)
3. Legal reviews if needed (48 hours for sensitive topics)
4. Final approval from content owner
5. Schedule publication
**Timeline:** 2-5 days (plan ahead!)

---

## EMERGENCY CONTENT PROTOCOL

**When scheduled content must be replaced:**

### Scenario 1: Breaking News in Industry
**Decision:** Swap planned post for timely commentary

**Process (30-minute emergency workflow):**
1. Assess: Is this relevant to our audience? (Y/N)
2. If YES: Does this fit a pillar? (Force to P2 or P3 if needed)
3. Use Opinion Post template (fastest to write)
4. Keep to 600-800 characters (speed over depth)
5. Post within 2-4 hours of news breaking
6. Engage aggressively for first hour

**Guardrail:** Only do if:
- Directly affects your audience
- You have informed perspective
- Can post within 4 hours (after that, not timely)

---

### Scenario 2: Post Mistake (Typo, Wrong Info)
**Decision:** Edit immediately if <5 minutes, otherwise leave

**Process:**
1. If <5 minutes since publish: Edit post, add comment noting correction
2. If >5 minutes: Leave post, add comment with correction
3. If factually wrong: Delete, post correction, apologize
4. Document in tracking sheet

**Guardrail:** Own mistakes quickly and transparently

---

### Scenario 3: Negative Backlash
**Decision:** Assess severity, respond proportionally

**Process:**
1. **Minor criticism (disagrees):** Respond professionally, invite discussion
2. **Valid criticism (you're wrong):** Acknowledge, thank, commit to learning
3. **Troll/Harassment:** Do not engage, block if necessary
4. **Major backlash:** Assess if post should be deleted (rare, save face)

**Guardrail:** Never get defensive, always professional

---

## CONTENT BACKLOG MANAGEMENT

**Purpose:** Never run out of ideas

### Building Backlog:
**Sources:**
- Customer conversations (pain points = content)
- Sales objections (answer publicly)
- Industry news (commentary opportunities)
- Questions in comments (expand to full posts)
- Team insights (internal learnings)

**Process:**
1. Keep "Ideas" note on phone
2. Add idea as soon as it strikes
3. Weekly: Transfer to backlog (50+ ideas minimum)
4. Monthly: Organize backlog by pillar
5. Quarterly: Refresh based on performance

**Backlog Structure:**
```
PILLAR 1 (Tactical Education)
- Idea 1: [Brief description]
- Idea 2: [Brief description]

PILLAR 2 (Industry Insights)
- Idea 1: [Brief description]
...
```

## REPURPOSING & RECYCLING

**Principle:** Great content deserves second life

### What to Repurpose:
- Posts with >6% engagement rate
- Posts with >20 saves
- Posts with deep comment discussions
- Posts that drove DMs or leads

### How to Repurpose:
1. **Repost (3-6 months later)**
   - Same content, updated data
   - Add: "Reposting because this got 500 saves last time:"

2. **Expand into Thread**
   - Turn single post into 5-7 connected posts
   - Post over one week, reference each other

3. **Turn into Carousel**
   - Take text post, visualize in slides
   - Different format = different audience reach

4. **Create Video Version**
   - Record yourself explaining concept
   - 60-90 seconds, authentic phone video

5. **External Content**
   - Blog post (expand 3-5x)
   - Newsletter (curate 5-10 related posts)
   - Webinar (deep dive on topic)

**Frequency:** Repurpose top 10% of content quarterly

## WORKFLOW TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "I don't have time to create content"
**Solution:**
- Batch creation: 90 minutes = 3 weeks of content
- Use templates religiously (don't start from scratch)

**Solution:**

### Problem: "My posts aren't getting engagement"
**Solution:**

### Problem: "I'm running out of ideas"
**Solution:**
- Repurpose top posts (update and reshare)
