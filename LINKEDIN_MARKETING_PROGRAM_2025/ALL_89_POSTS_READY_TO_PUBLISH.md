Want to 3x your LinkedIn engagement? Here's the exact framework:

I grew from 2% to 7% engagement in 90 days using this system.

The 5-step process:

1. **Hook in 120 characters or less**
Your first line determines everything. Make it punch.

2. **Add a curiosity gap**
Promise value but don't give away the ending in your hook.

3. **Use line breaks every 1-2 sentences**
White space = readability = longer dwell time = algorithm boost.

4. **End with a specific question**
Not "thoughts?" but something that prompts real answers.

5. **Reply to EVERY comment in first hour**
Algorithm rewards early engagement velocity.

Bonus: Post on Tuesday at 8:30am. Tuesday has 6.9% higher reply rates than any other day.

What's your current engagement rate?

**Pillar:** Industry Insights | **Target:** C-Suite, Sales Leaders

B2B sales cycles increased 37% since 2020.
But deal sizes only grew 12%.

This is a crisis hiding in plain sight.

The data (Gartner 2025):
→ Average sales cycle: 9.3 months (was 6.8 in 2020)
→ Average deal size: $67K (was $60K in 2020)
→ Decision makers involved: 8.4 (was 5.2 in 2020)

What's happening:
• More stakeholders = slower decisions
• Economic uncertainty = more scrutiny  
• Vendor saturation = analysis paralysis

The math doesn't work:
37% longer cycles = 37% higher CAC
12% bigger deals ≠ justify the extra cost
Result: Squeezed margins for most B2B companies

What to do:
1. Qualify harder (say no to long-cycle deals)
2. Enable champions (arm them to sell internally)
3. Unbundle offerings (sell smaller, expand later)

Are your sales cycles getting longer too?

Unpopular opinion: Stop posting daily on LinkedIn.

The data doesn't support it.

I analyzed 1,000 creators over 6 months:

**Daily posters (7x/week):**
• Avg engagement: 2.1%
• Follower growth: 12%/quarter
• Burnout rate: 68% quit within 6 months

**Quality posters (3-4x/week):**
• Avg engagement: 5.4% (2.6x higher)
• Follower growth: 18%/quarter
• Burnout rate: 15%

The reason:
→ Quality beats quantity (algorithm rewards depth)
→ Audience fatigue (too much from one person)
→ Creator sustainability (burnout kills the long game)

Better strategy:
Post 3-4x per week (Tue/Wed/Thu + one bonus)
Make each post high-effort (800+ characters, real value)
Spend saved time engaging with others' content

Consistency beats frequency. Every time.

Do you post daily? What's your engagement rate?

**Pillar:** Personal Stories | **Target:** All

I just lost our biggest client. $240K in annual revenue. Gone.

Here's what happened:

6 months ago, I took them for granted. Stopped checking in. Stopped innovating. Assumed they'd stay forever.

Last week, they called to "chat."
I knew immediately.

They were kind. Professional. They'd found a better fit.
The truth: I stopped being that better fit.

What I learned:
→ No client is "safe"
→ Complacency kills relationships
→ Today's value doesn't guarantee tomorrow's contract

Now? I have a calendar reminder to check in with every key client monthly.
Not to sell. To listen.

Have you ever lost a client you thought was locked in?

**Pillar:** Customer Success | **Target:** All

My client just tripled their monthly recurring revenue in 90 days.

From $30K to $92K MRR.

Here's exactly what we did:

**The Challenge:**
They had product-market fit but no scalable acquisition system.
Every customer required founder-led sales.
Impossible to scale.

**The Solution:**
Week 1-2: Built LinkedIn organic engine
→ Founder posted 4x/week
→ Tactical education + thought leadership mix
→ Built authority fast

Week 3-4: Layered in cold outbound
→ Targeted 500 ICPs
→ Used founder's content as social proof
→ 23% reply rate (vs 3% industry avg)

Week 5-8: Closed and scaled
→ 15 demos booked
→ 8 closed deals
→ Average ACV: $11.5K

**The Result:**
$30K → $92K MRR (3.07x)
100% organic + outbound (no paid ads)
Repeatable system built

The key: Content + outbound working together, not separately.

Facing a similar challenge? Let's talk.
