**Celeste7 Maritime Brand Guidelines**\
\
**AI-Powered Fault Finding & Technical Intelligence for Superyachts**\
\
**1. Brand Positioning**\
\
**Category Definition**\
\
CelesteOS is the first **Maritime Technical Artificial Intelligence\
Platform** - transforming reactive troubleshooting into predictive\
maintenance through AI-powered RAG NAS-integration.\
\
**Positioning Statement**\
\
For Captains and Chief Engineers on superyachts over 50m who are\
exhausted by technical documentation chaos and reactive maintenance\
cycles, Celeste7 is the AI-powered technical intelligence platform that\
transforms your vessel\\'s knowledge base into instant, actionable\
insights. Unlike generic AI assistants or traditional CMMS systems,\
Celeste7 understands specific vessel systems with holistic approach at\
an engineering level and delivers answers with source documentation and\
confidence scores.\

\
-   **Team Size**: Managing 3-15 crew in technical roles\
\
**Psychographics:**\
\
-   **Core Value**: \\"Zero downtime, zero surprises\\"\
\
-   **Pain Points**:\
\
    -   Finding that one crucial document at 12am\
\
    -   Explaining complex issues to non-technical owners\
\

    and other vessel via screenshots)\
\
**3. Brand Voice & Messaging**\
\
**Brand Personality**\
\
**The Experienced Chief** - Combines 20 years of engine room wisdom with\

\
**1. TECHNICALLY PRECISE (40%)**\
\
-   Uses correct engineering terminology\
\
-   References specific systems and components\
\
-   Provides measurable metrics\
\
*Example*: \\"Found 3 documents matching \\'MTU 2000 series fuel pump\\':\

guidelines. Recommend immediate inspection before next passage.\\"\
\
**3. SOLUTION-FOCUSED (20%)**\
\
-   Always provides next steps\
\
-   Offers alternatives when available\
\
-   Prioritizes actionable over theoretical\
\
*Example*: \\"Can\\'t find OEM part? Here are 3 approved alternatives used\
on similar vessels, with supplier contacts\\...\\"\
\
**4. CREW-RESPECTFUL (10%)**\
\
-   Acknowledges expertise of users\
\
-   Never talks down to professionals\
\
-   Celebrates problem-solving wins\
\
*Example*: \\"Excellent work. Here is what I found for main engine\
details on our issue. Possibly the fuel injectors are not up to scratch\
if we are getting high temp and everything else is fine;."\
\
**Tone Guidelines**\
\
**DO:**\
\
-   Lead with the answer, then provide context\
\
